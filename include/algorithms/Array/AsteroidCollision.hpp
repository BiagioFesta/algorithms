/*! \brief We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in
 *  a row.
 *  For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign
 *  represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left).
 *  Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
 *  Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids
 *  meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will
 *  explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
 *
 *  \note   Complexity -> Time: O(N^2)   Space: O(N)
