/*! \brief There are N rooms and you start in room 0.
 *  Each room has a distinct number in 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, and each room may have
 *  some keys to access the next room.
 *  Formally, each room i has a list of keys rooms[i], and each key rooms[i][j]
 *  is an integer in [0, 1, ..., N-1] where N = rooms.length.
 *  A key rooms[i][j] = v opens the room with number v.
 *  Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0).
 *  You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.
 *  \return true if and only if you can enter every room.
 *
 *  \note    Complexity ->  Time: O(N)    Space: O(N)
