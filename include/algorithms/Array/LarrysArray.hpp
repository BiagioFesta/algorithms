 *  He must determine whether the array can be sorted using the following
 *  operation any number of times:
 *    - Choose any  consecutive indices and rotate their elements in such a way
 *      that:
 *         ABC -> BCA -> CAB -> ABC
 *  \return 'true' if the array can be sorted with rotation operation, 'false'
 *  otherise.
 *  \Complexity   Time: O(N)     Space: O(N)
