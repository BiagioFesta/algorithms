/*! \brief We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the
 *  length of A.
 *  The number of (global) inversions is the number of i < j with
 *  0 <= i < j < N and A[i] > A[j].
 *  The number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 <= i < N
 *  and A[i] > A[i+1].
 *  Return true if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the
 *  number of local inversions.
 *
 *  \note   Complexity  ->  Time: O(N)  Space: O(1)
