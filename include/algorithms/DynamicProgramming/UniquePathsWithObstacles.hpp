/*! \brief A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid.
 *  The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
 *  is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
 *  Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths
 *  would there be?
 *  An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
