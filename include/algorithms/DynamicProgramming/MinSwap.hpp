/*! \brief We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.
 *  We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are
 *  in the same index position in their respective sequences.
 *  At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing
 *  \note A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if:
 *                A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].
 *  Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences
 *  strictly increasing.
 *  \note It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.
 *  \note A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the
 *  range [1, 1000].
 *
 *  \note   Complexity -> Time: O(N)   Space: O(N)
 *  \note The space complexity could be considered O(1) because 1000 max
