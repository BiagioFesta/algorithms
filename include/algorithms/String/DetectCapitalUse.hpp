 *  is right or not.
 *  We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the
 *  following cases holds:
 *    1) All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
 *    2) All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
 *    3) Only the first letter in this word is capital if it has more than one
 *       letter, like "Google".
 *  Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
 *  \return Whether the string use capital in right way or not.
 *  \note The string must not be empty.
 *  \note  Complexity ->   Time: O(N)    Space: O(1)
