/*! \brief An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption
 *  scheme.
 *  First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let 'L'  be the length of this
 *  text.
 *  Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the
 *  following constraints:
 *     floor(L) <= #rows <= #cols <= ceil(L)
 *  Ensure #rows * #cols >= L
 *  In case of multiple grids with the above conditions, pick the minimum area.
 *  The encoded message is obtained by displaying the characters in a column,
 *  inserting a space, and then displaying the next column and inserting a
 *  space, and so on.
 *
 *  Eg.   chillout
 *    c h i
 *    l l o
 *    u t
 *           ---> clu hlt io
 *
 *  \note Complexity ->  Time:  O(N)     Space: O(N)
