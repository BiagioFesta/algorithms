 *  cache. It should support the following operations: `get` and `put`.
 *    - get(key): Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key
 *                exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
 *    - put(key, value): Set or insert the value if the key is not already
 *                       present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should
 *                       invalidate the least recently used item before
 *                       inserting a new item.
